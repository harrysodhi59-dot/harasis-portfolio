🎟️ Ticket Checking Application (Python Programming Project)
📌 Overview

This project involves the development of a Python-based Ticket Checking Application that simulates a real-world ticket verification system.
The goal was to design a simple but logical application that validates ticket information and determines whether a ticket is valid or invalid based on predefined rules.

This project focuses on programming fundamentals, application logic, and problem-solving, complementing my machine learning and data analytics projects.

🎯 Problem Statement

Ticket verification is a common requirement in many real-world systems such as events, transportation, and access control.

The application aims to:

Validate ticket IDs or codes

Check ticket status (valid, invalid, expired, or already used)

Provide clear output to the user

This project demonstrates how basic programming logic can be applied to solve practical problems.

🔎 Application Workflow

1️⃣ User Input

User enters ticket information (ID/code)

2️⃣ Validation Logic

Check ticket format

Verify ticket existence

Validate ticket status

3️⃣ Decision Output

Ticket accepted

Ticket rejected with reason

This structured flow ensures clarity and correctness in the application logic.

🧩 Core Features

Input handling and validation

Conditional logic for ticket status checks

Loop-based flow control

Clear user feedback through console output

Simple, readable code structure

🛠️ Implementation Details

The application was built using:

Python functions for modular logic

Conditional statements to enforce rules

Loops for repeated validation

Clean code structure for readability

The design emphasizes correctness, simplicity, and maintainability.
