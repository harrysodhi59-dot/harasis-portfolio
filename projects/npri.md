🌍 NPRI Oil Sands Environmental Pollution Analysis & Forecasting
📌 Overview

This project analyzes environmental pollutant releases reported through the
NPRI (National Pollutant Release Inventory) for oil sands extraction facilities.
The goal was to identify pollution trends, high-emission substances, and create forecasting insights to support environmental interpretation.

This project demonstrates skills in data analysis, trend forecasting, and environmental dataset handling.

🧾 What is NPRI?

The NPRI is a public Canadian database that tracks:

Pollutant releases

Transfers and disposals

Industrial emission reporting

Oil sands extraction facilities must report emissions annually, making this dataset ideal for environmental trend analysis.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze historical pollutant releases over multiple years

Identify high-emission pollutants and patterns

Compare multiple oil sands facilities

Build a forecasting approach to estimate future emission behaviour

Visualize results for interpretation and reporting

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Key steps included:

Importing multi-year NPRI datasets

Converting units and standardizing pollutant names

Handling missing entries and outliers

Aggregating emissions by:

Year

Facility

Pollutant type

Created a clean, analysis-ready dataset for trend analysis.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Major findings:

Certain pollutants (e.g., NOx, SO₂, PM) show consistent upward or downward trends

Some facilities reported significantly higher emissions

Year-over-year fluctuations were aligned with operational activities

Air emissions dominated over water/land pathways

Visuals included:

Yearly line charts

Facility comparison bar charts

Top 10 pollutants by total emissions

Distribution plots

📈 Forecasting Approach

Using time-series logic, we:

Analyzed pollutant trends

Estimated near-term forecasts (ex: next 1–3 years)

Highlighted pollutants likely to increase or decrease

Forecasting supported environmental planning and early warning interpretation.

🌱 Environmental Insights

Key insights included:

Identification of “high concern” pollutants

Facility-level patterns and potential risk areas

Yearly emissions trajectories

Data-driven signals for environmental monitoring programs

🔧 Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Time-series logic

NPRI public dataset

👤 My Role

I contributed to:

Importing and cleaning NPRI datasets

Building visualizations

Performing trend analysis

Creating forecasting logic

Preparing presentation-ready insights

🧩 Reflection

This project strengthened my ability to:

Work with environmental datasets

Analyze multi-year trends

Convert raw industrial data into meaningful explanations

Communicate results visually

It also helped me understand how machine learning and data analysis can support environmental decision-making.
